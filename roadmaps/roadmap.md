# [infra-backup]: Roadmap

## Core Goals (2025)
- [ ] Zip and backup all key files/folders (see: `.md` docs, bot configs)
- [ ] Encrypt backups with [gpg]
- [ ] Push to [github] (private repo, or encrypt and push)

## Later
- [ ] Automatic restore scripts
- [ ] Integration with [pentestbot-rust] and [auto-pay-bot] for handoff

All design/AI-linked research in `context.md`.
